# Machine Learning Self-Project and Tutorials

This repository contains my machine learning self-project and tutorials. It serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in exploring machine learning concepts and applying them to real-world problems.

## Project Description

In this project, I aim to learn various machine learning algorithms and techniques. The projects will be implemented using Python, C++ programming languages, CUDA and etc.

## Tutorials

The tutorials in this repository are designed to provide step-by-step guidance on different machine learning topics. Each tutorial focuses on a specific concept or technique and includes code examples and explanations to help me understand and implement it.

The following tutorials are currently available:

[//]: # (1. [Tutorial 1: Introduction to Machine Learning]&#40;tutorial1.md&#41;)

[//]: # (2. [Tutorial 2: Data Preprocessing]&#40;tutorial2.md&#41;)

[//]: # (3. [Tutorial 3: Regression Models]&#40;tutorial3.md&#41;)

[//]: # (4. [Tutorial 4: Classification Models]&#40;tutorial4.md&#41;)

[//]: # (5. [Tutorial 5: Evaluation Metrics]&#40;tutorial5.md&#41;)

Feel free to explore the tutorials and follow along to enhance your understanding of machine learning.
